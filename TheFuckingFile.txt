Paco Gutierrez age 9, always wanted a Nintendo console. Due to being extremely poor living in Venezuela it was just a dream. Using creativity he made a cardboard Super Mario game, posted it on YouTube and the video went viral. Thanks to the video, Nintendo CEO Doug Bowser personally traveled to Venezuela, to give Paco a Cease and Desist order and sue his family for 200 million dollars

Hey Mitch! Sorry it's been a while, I got hep K from SALAMI (Again)! I'm here now and will try to chort more often! Btw, did you ever finish the six game no hit gauntlet of baby games?



Hi Mulchini. Did you chort today? Did you moisturize your chonda? Will you power raid chat? Did you tell the nintendo refs about your hepatitis k? do they know about your triple pink eye?




Mitch serious question. Why is the stream called SIX game no hit when you only play TWO games, get hit, and got SEVEN games listed. Thank you for clearing this up

Mitch are you a power bottom? oops I mean power top oops I mean power gamer oops SALAMI!


Mitch is indeed a legendary chair sniffer known for his strong nostrils. Mitch's fame comes from AGDQ chair sniffing and his incredible knowledge of the different ways to covertly sniff (more than just chairs)

one day when i was at wendys, this strange man came over to me and introduced himself as papa morch flounder pounder . He then told me I had to leave. As I walk outside I look in, and he is sniffing my chair??


now that mitchflowerpower has retired from streaming, he has found new hobbies like collecting used socks (he doesn't wash them) and eating old fries from the dumpster behind wendys

Tickle your chonda with the all new Wendy's® Breakfast Baconator®: including our delicious fresh, never frozen grilled sausage, American cheese, Applewood Smoked Bacon, and a fresh egg, MORE cheese, MORE bacon, and chort sauce! Don't just break your fast, DESTROY it with the new Wendy's® Breakfast Baconator®.

they say you're washed mortch but you're actually just CLEAN ASF

My car was super muddy so I decided to clean it today. It took quite a while and when I went back inside my wife asked if I was finished. I just said “MitchFlowerPower”. She nodded in agreement. She know it was truly and thoroughly washed.

Everyone just needs to remember the fact that Mitch always has a full diaper. He’s an actual human. And if he needs to take a break from streaming to chort, we just need to respect that and be there for him when he does come back!  He doesn’t need any extra diapers put on him. He already smells really stinky about not being a dinky diaper baby, and we don’t need shame him for it

 Hi mortch, it’s me, your only Viewer. For Months I have created the illusion that you are streaming to a large audience. But here’s the truth: all these people in the chat are me. And now, for you to be convinced of this, I will send this message from all my accounts.


Who gifted me a sub? And how do I turn it off as I no longer want to enjoy watching this stream? I am trying to move forward with my emotional pain from this cornmunity sorry.

You're practicing wrong. You just practiced getting it right 10% of the time. Look. Practice until you get it right at least 3/5 times, and you're setting yourself up to get it 60% of the time. See? Practice is the purposeful reptition of accuracy. You just snarked at me earlier, I'm just paying it forward "morch"! Just trying to help. If I'm nice it doesn't catch your attention anyway. I also assume you didn't know as much about classical piano as me. You see, the princple of how to practice is universal. I love your stream by the way and intended no offense.

Listen, okay? I know you don't mean it in offense, but like do you know who I am?  Like, do you know what I've done with my career and with this game? Do you not think that I have the slightest understanding of how practice works?  I've literally been speedrunning this game for over 12 years.  I've made an absolute career out of this game that pays for my entire bills and family's. Absolutely based numerous world records.  OK, I just don't like I've made an entire career out of this, based on being consistent and getting world records.  Like you must know that I have obviously a sliver of understanding of how consistency and practice works, right? Yeah I'm boasting because I never get a chance to do this.  I never get a chance to humble brag. 

I sexually identify as a single, Pringle, ready to mingle. Ever since I was a potato I dreamed of being thin sliced, covered in disgusting oil then heated in a medium oven until reaching climax at the micro second of golden-browness. People bully me, and say things like "what the fuck, you aren't a Pringle", but I know deep down they are just jealous of my inner beauty.

Do you guys just copy and paste anything you see in chat?  You guys are nothing but a bunch of no-name brands.  You guys are the President's Choice of soda.  You guys are the Fruity Hoops of Froot Loops.  Yeah, that's right, I said it.

It’s me, your only fan. For Months I have created the illusion that a large audience subscribes to your only fans. But here’s the truth: all these people subscribed there are me. And now, for you to be convinced of this, I will DM you this message from all my accounts.

For the new people - the farting noise that can be used on stream comes from Mitch's drunk stream where he placed the mic by his hole and let out that which now is very infamously "the geyser incident". The VoD was deleted.

I've been following this stream regularly since only the start of the recent push a month ago, but when I logged in and saw that run I immediately pulled my foreskin over the screen to express my joy

dude's a complete dict if you try to say anything about how you think things work in smb3. it's fun teasing with the regulars and ppl who donate, but really sharp and dismissive if you're anyone else

Big black square. Reset where? Big black square. Reset where? Big black square. Reset where? Big black square. Reset where? Big black square. Reset where? Big black square. Reset where? Cheer 100

Mitch is very "come on guys, don't tease me about <THING>" on purpose, which gets people riled up and memeing. He knows it, and it's a great community building exercise. It's all part of the broadcast. 
He naturally brings that kind of lore and spectacle to his channel.

God, I wish there was a dating sim where the characters are Mitch and the chat members 🔥

On Tuesday, March 25, 2025, Mitchflowerpower showed the world where his true loyalties lie. He had no reservations about banning his current wife, ForrestKitty, from his own twitch chat. Having claimed it was chat's doing, he forgot that chat was just enforcing one of his own rules. Mitch has proven he will do anything to keep chat happy, even if that means betraying his own current wife. RIP ForrestKitty.

I'm not trying to tell you how to run your stream, bro - but with that metronome overlay, it is blocking out the neon sign that should say "mitchflowerpower" yet it is now cut off. People are going to think it says "itch" not Mitch... All you need to do is shift the neon sign a bit to the left (your left, our right) and it will be fine. Or you can get rid of the metronome overlay since it is clearly doing nothing for you. 󠀀

Big grats but man wtf happened to his chat. Used to watch mitch daily like 8-10 years ago and was chill. Now it's just endless repetitive meme spam.

Look out, it's the "so bad snake"! snekege  FeelsSnakeMan þþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþ
